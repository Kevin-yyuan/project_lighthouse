- **Conditional Coloring**: Visual feedback for predictions

## PREDICTION METHODOLOGY

### Data Science Approach:

#### 1. Feature Engineering:
- **Contractor Analysis**: Historical performance metrics
- **Project Categorization**: Type-based risk factors
- **Geographic Factors**: City-specific cost patterns
- **Temporal Features**: Schedule variance patterns

#### 2. Model Training:
- **Training Data**: 200 synthetic projects with realistic patterns
- **Validation**: Cross-validation and holdout testing
- **Feature Importance**: Contractor is primary predictor (60%+ influence)

#### 3. Prediction Logic:
- **Risk Scoring**: Based on historical contractor performance and project complexity
- **Cost Forecasting**: Considers contractor efficiency, project type, and market factors
- **Timeline Prediction**: Accounts for contractor speed, project scope, and seasonal factors

### Business Intelligence:

#### Contractor Performance Analysis:
- **Cost Variance**: Range from -2.5% to +17.3% budget deviation
- **Schedule Performance**: 27-81 days variance from planned duration
- **Risk Profile**: Each contractor has distinct risk patterns

#### Predictive Insights:
- **Early Warning System**: Identifies high-risk projects before issues arise
- **Budget Protection**: Flags projects likely to exceed budget
- **Resource Optimization**: Informs contractor selection and scheduling
